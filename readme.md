Drupal 7 theme - Open Charity

Used modules:
	- backup and migrate
	- ctools
	- empty front page
	- libraries
	- pathauto
	- token
	- views
	- views slideshow

I divided website into several parts. 
Each part is a drupal Block, you can display in any Region of Drupal site, in any order.
Each block is a template of "Views" module.
Each Views template takes content from different Content Types.

PHP templates makes cleen html code, without crazy nesting tags inside tags, and without long machine-names of .classes and #id

OpenCharity.sitearchive.tar.zip is backup created by "Backup and Migrate" module.
